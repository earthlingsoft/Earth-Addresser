# Ideas

* handle blank address
* make file written message more visible (especially when creation is so quick that no progress bar is seen)
* improve handling of no-network errors
* improve FAIL report
* improve FAIL re-lookup / do not re-lookup ALL addresses?
* use Container / Sandbox
* display map in application
* use framework provided strings (AB?, CL?) for display rather than building our own
* use geocoding precision info
* French readme
* add pointer to images
